Using Blosc2 For A Fast Exploration Of The Milky Way (Or Any Other NDim Dataset)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

    One of the latest and more exciting additions in Blosc2 is its Blosc2 NDim layer. It allows to create and read n-dimensional datasets in an extremely efficient way thanks to a completely general n-dim 2-level partitioning, allowing to slice and dice arbitrary large (and compressed!) data in a more fine-grained way.

    Having a second partition means that we have better flexibility to fit the different partitions at the different CPU cache levels; typically the first partition (aka chunks) should be made to fit in L3 cache, whereas the second partition (aka blocks) should rather fit in L2/L1 caches (depending on whether compression ratio or speed is desired).

    As an example, we are going to use the Blosc NDim capabilities to enable a fast exploration of the Milky Way. We will use the Gaia DR3 dataset, which is a catalog of 1.7 billion stars in our galaxy. The dataset is 100 GB in size and it is stored in a 3D array of 1.7 billion rows, 6 columns and 3D coordinates (x, y, z).

Introduction
------------

Blosc is a high-performance compressor that has been optimized for binary data. Its design allows for faster transmission of data to the processor cache than the traditional, non-compressed, direct memory fetch approach through an memcpy() OS call. This can be useful not only in reducing the size of large datasets on-disk or in-memory, but also in accelerating memory-bound computations, which is typical in vector-vector operations.

Blosc2 is the new iteration of the Blosc 1.x series, which adds more features and better documentation. In particular, Blosc2 NDim (:cite:`BDT23-blosc2-ndim-intro`) excels at reading multi-dimensional slices, thanks to its innovative pineapple-style partitioning. To learn more, see...



Bibliographies, citations and block quotes
------------------------------------------

If you want to include a ``.bib`` file, do so above by placing  :code:`:bibliography: yourFilenameWithoutExtension` as above (replacing ``mybib``) for a file named :code:`yourFilenameWithoutExtension.bib` after removing the ``.bib`` extension.

**Do not include any special characters that need to be escaped or any spaces in the bib-file's name**. Doing so makes bibTeX cranky, & the rst to LaTeX+bibTeX transform won't work.

To reference citations contained in that bibliography use the :code:`:cite:`citation-key`` role, as in :cite:`hume48` (which literally is :code:`:cite:`hume48`` in accordance with the ``hume48`` cite-key in the associated ``mybib.bib`` file).

However, if you use a bibtex file, this will overwrite any manually written references.

So what would previously have registered as a in text reference ``[Atr03]_`` for

::

     [Atr03] P. Atreides. *How to catch a sandworm*,
           Transactions on Terraforming, 21(3):261-300, August 2003.

what you actually see will be an empty reference rendered as **[?]**.

E.g., :cite:`Atr03`.


If you wish to have a block quote, you can just indent the text, as in

    When it is asked, What is the nature of all our reasonings concerning matter of fact? the proper answer seems to be, that they are founded on the relation of cause and effect. When again it is asked, What is the foundation of all our reasonings and conclusions concerning that relation? it may be replied in one word, experience. But if we still carry on our sifting humor, and ask, What is the foundation of all conclusions from experience? this implies a new question, which may be of more difficult solution and explication. :cite:`hume48`

Dois in bibliographies
++++++++++++++++++++++

In order to include a doi in your bibliography, add the doi to your bibliography
entry as a string. For example:

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Book{hume48,
     author =  "David Hume",
     year =    "1748",
     title =   "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
     address =     "Indianapolis, IN",
     publisher =   "Hackett",
     doi = "10.1017/CBO9780511808432",
   }


If there are errors when adding it due to non-alphanumeric characters, see if
wrapping the doi in ``\detokenize`` works to solve the issue.

.. code-block:: bibtex

   @Book{hume48,
     author =  "David Hume",
     year =    "1748",
     title =   "An enquiry concerning human understanding",
     address =     "Indianapolis, IN",
     publisher =   "Hackett",
     doi = \detokenize{10.1017/CBO9780511808432},
   }

Source code examples
--------------------

Of course, no paper would be complete without some source code.  Without
highlighting, it would look like this::

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

With code-highlighting:

.. code-block:: python

   def sum(a, b):
       """Sum two numbers."""

       return a + b

Maybe also in another language, and with line numbers:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:

   int main() {
       for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
           /* do something */
       }
       return 0;
   }

Or a snippet from the above code, starting at the correct line number:

.. code-block:: c
   :linenos:
   :linenostart: 2

   for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
       /* do something */
   }

Important Part
--------------

It is well known :cite:`Atr03` that Spice grows on the planet Dune.  Test
some maths, for example :math:`e^{\pi i} + 3 \delta`.  Or maybe an
equation on a separate line:

.. math::

   g(x) = \int_0^\infty f(x) dx

or on multiple, aligned lines:

.. math::
   :type: eqnarray

   g(x) &=& \int_0^\infty f(x) dx \\
        &=& \ldots

The area of a circle and volume of a sphere are given as

.. math::
   :label: circarea

   A(r) = \pi r^2.

.. math::
   :label: spherevol

   V(r) = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

We can then refer back to Equation (:ref:`circarea`) or
(:ref:`spherevol`) later.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it. :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference auto-numbered
figures.

We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+

Unfortunately, restructuredtext can be picky about tables, so if it simply
won't work try raw LaTeX:


.. raw:: latex

   \begin{table*}

     \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
     \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Area in square miles}\tabularnewline
     \cline{2-4}
      & Large Horizontal Area & Large Vertical Area & Smaller Square Area\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Albers Equal Area  & 7,498.7 & 10,847.3 & 35.8\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Web Mercator & 13,410.0 & 18,271.4 & 63.0\tabularnewline
